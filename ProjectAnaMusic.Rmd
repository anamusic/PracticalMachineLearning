Data 
---

I took my data from the links below. Training and test data for the project are available here: 

- https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv 

- https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for the project come from the source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. The data are quantifying exercises movement measured of six participants.


The goal of the project
---

The goal of this project is to predict variable *classe*, where we measure how well did they do the exercises, and not only how much of a particular activity they did.

I used the training data to build and train the model, with which I predict variable *classe* in the test data. 

Modelling
---

In code I used some packages:
```
library(caret);
library(gbm);
library(survival);
library(splines);
library(plyr)
```
I set seed to 1 to always get the same result. I also set working directory to a directory where I saved all files.

From **pml-training.csv** file I loaded the data and saved them to a varible *training*.
```
set.seed(1)

dir = "local_directory"
setwd(dir)
training = read.csv("pml-training.csv")
```

To get some information of the *training* variable I have built a density function for each of the columns. I also wanted to build a *featurePlot*, but there are 160 columns in the *training* variable, what is too much to show on a chart. In our case (*classe* is a class type variable) we get a similar information from density function plot then from *featurePlot* (qq plots of each variable to the *classe* variable). 

Below are few examples of density functions:

**slika**

In the data there are some columns with *NA* varibles. I decided not to use them, because values in those columns do not cover the whole space. They only cover aproximately 2% of it, therefore I deleted them from the *training* variable.

```
training <- training[,colSums(is.na(training)) == 0] 
```

I divide the training variable into two parts, the train set and the test set. I chose ratio p=0.75.

```
inTrain = createDataPartition(y=training$classe,p=0.75,list=FALSE)
train = training[inTrain,]
test = training[-inTrain,]
```

To set parameters for a model we use *trainControl* function. I will show later how different parameters (*number* and *repeats*) affect the quality of predicted results. 

```
fitControl <- trainControl(method  = "repeatedcv",
                           number  = N,
                           repeats = M)
```

We use *train* function to build the model. I have decided to use **gbm** method, because it is appropriate for classification problems. I will also show how preprocessing (*pca*) affect the quality of predicted results.

```
modFit <- train(classe ~ variables,
                method     = "gbm",
                data       = train,
                trControl  = fitControl,
                preProcess = "pca",
                verbose    = FALSE)
```

Based on dansity functions I have decided for some input variables for the model. I have chosen the following (but will add/remove some of them and present the results later):

```
variables = yaw_belt + total_accel_belt + accel_belt_z + roll_arm + yaw_arm + total_accel_arm + gyros_arm_x + gyros_arm_y + gyros_arm_z + accel_arm_z + pitch_forearm + roll_dumbbell
```

We check importance of model variables with the following comand:

```
varImp(modFit, scale = FALSE)
```

and we predict outturns with:
```
outturn = predict(modFit,test)
```

To check quality of the model we calculate the ration of correctly predicted values of the *classe* variable to the number of all with command:

```
length(which(outturn == test$classe))/nrow(test)
```
